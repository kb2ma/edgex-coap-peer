EdgeX CoAP Peer
###############

Overview
********
This project provides a Zephyr based CoAP peer example for the EdgeX device-coap-c_ project.

This example will make POST requests to device-coap-c's resource for asynchronously generated data. The example includes sample Kconfig files for both DTLS PSK and nosec security.

The example sends a POST to:

.. code-block:: console

    coap(s)://192.0.2.2/a1r/d1/int

In other words the protocol portion either is ``coaps`` for DTLS or ``coap`` for nosec. The example assumes the device is named ``d1`` in EdgeX.

Building and Running
********************

This example includes a ``prj.conf`` to initialize the build. The example also includes two complete Kconfig setups ``dtls.config`` and ``nosec.config`` which can be copied to ``./build/zephyr/.config`` for a `native_posix` build.

For a DTLS PSK build, the client identity and key are defined in ``src/dummy_psk.h``. The key must match the key used in the device-coap-c service.

A run of the app sends three POST requests, separated by three seconds. The output should look like:

.. code-block:: console

    UART_0 connected to pseudotty: /dev/pts/9
